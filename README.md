# medical-knowledge-retrieval-chatbot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) medical chatbot designed to provide reliable health-related information by retrieving relevant context from medical PDF documents. The application preprocesses documents through intelligent chunking, converts them into vector embeddings using sentence-transformers, and stores them in a FAISS vector database for fast semantic retrieval. User queries are answered by a Hugging Face language model (FLAN-T5) augmented with retrieved medical context, delivered through a Flask-based web interface. The system operates locally and does not rely on paid APIs.
